# 🛡️ NMAP Network Scanning Lab

## Objective
This project explores network scanning and security evaluation using **Nmap**, a powerful tool for discovering hosts and services on a network.  
In this lab, you will learn:
- Port scanning and service detection  
- Operating system fingerprinting  
- Practical applications of Nmap in real-world scenarios  
- Ethical considerations in network testing  

---

## Lab Overview
Nmap provides several features useful for both penetration testers and attackers:
- **Port Scanning**: Identify open ports to detect potential points of entry.  
- **Service Detection**: Determine which services are running and their versions to locate vulnerabilities.  
- **OS Fingerprinting**: Identify the target’s operating system and hardware to customize security analysis.  

These capabilities make Nmap an effective tool for the reconnaissance phase of cybersecurity assessments.

## Steps Taken
1. **Set Up Environment**: Open a terminal and install Nmap.  
2. **Identify Active Hosts**: Use the `-sn` flag to ping scan the network and find online devices.  
3. **Scan Ports**: Use TCP scan flags (`-sS`, `-sF`, `-sN`, `-sX`) to determine open ports.  
4. **Service Detection**: Use `-sV` to identify running services and versions.  
5. **OS Detection**: Use `-O` to fingerprint the target system’s operating system.  
6. **Aggressive Scanning**: Use `-A` to gather comprehensive information including OS, service versions, scripts, and traceroute.
